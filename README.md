Gettting And Cleaning Data Course Project
-----------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description of the data that was obtained is available at the site:

The data for this project can be found here:

There's an R script run_analysis.R as part of this project that does the following. 

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Also included in this project is a code book with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries that were calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
